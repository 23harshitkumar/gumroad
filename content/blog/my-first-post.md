## Welcome to the Blog

This is the main content of my **first blog post**. It's written in Markdown.

Here's a list:
* Item 1
* Item 2

And a bit of `inline code`.

```ruby
def hello
  puts "Hello, world!"
end
```

Also, create a placeholder image at `app/assets/images/blog/placeholder.jpg`. If you don't have one handy, just any small JPG will do for now.

2.  **Update `Blog::PostsController`:**
    Once the sample post is in place, we'll uncomment and fill in the logic in `Blog::PostsController` to use the `BlogService` methods to fetch data for the views.

Let me know when you've created the sample Markdown file and placeholder image!
