  <h2>Financial Planning 101 for Independent Creators</h2>
  <p>Turning your passion into a sustainable business requires more than just creating great products; it also means managing your finances effectively. For many independent creators, this can feel daunting, but a few key practices can set you up for success.</p>
  <h3>Budgeting Basics:</h3>
  <p>Understand your income and expenses. Track both your business-related costs (software, marketing, fees) and your personal living expenses. Simple spreadsheet templates or budgeting apps can be invaluable.</p>
  <h3>Setting Aside for Taxes:</h3>
  <p>As an independent creator, you're likely responsible for your own income taxes, and potentially sales tax (though Gumroad helps a lot here by acting as Merchant of Record for sales tax on the platform!). Regularly set aside a percentage of your earnings for taxes to avoid surprises.</p>
  <h3>Pricing Your Work:</h3>
  <p>Don't undervalue your work! Research your market, understand the value you provide, and price your products accordingly. Consider your time, expertise, and the costs of running your business.</p>
  <h3>Planning for Fluctuations:</h3>
  <p>Creator income can be variable. Building an emergency fund and planning for slower months can provide peace of mind and stability.</p>
